= AWS tools

== Note

This is very beta, use at your own risk. That said, I am using it production.

== Description

A simple gem to provide aws command line tools, currently only snapshots.  snapshots allows you to create snapshots from volumes on aws and deletes snapshots greater than the keep parameter.

== Usage

snapshot -v volume-id -k 2 -d "Some Description" -q 

Creates a snapshot of volume-id, and deletes all snapshots except for the current and the last most recent.

== Installation 

Ensure you set your amazon keys.

export EC2_PRIVATE_KEY=/path/to/private_key.pem 
export EC2_CERT=/path/to/cert.pem

gem install awstools

snapshot -v volume-id -k 2 -d "Some Description"

snapshot --help for params

== Reason

I looked for a simple tool to do this and didn't find anything I liked so I put this together.
